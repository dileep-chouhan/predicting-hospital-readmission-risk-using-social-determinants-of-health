# Predicting Hospital Readmission Risk using Social Determinants of Health

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for 30-day hospital readmission risk.  The model leverages a dataset containing patient demographics, clinical data, and social determinants of health (SDOH) to identify individuals at high risk of readmission. This allows for proactive interventions, optimized resource allocation, and potentially improved patient outcomes. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`


## Example Output

The script will print key findings from the exploratory data analysis to the console, including descriptive statistics and insights derived from the data.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., `.png` files showing distributions of key variables, model performance metrics, etc.) within the `output` directory.  The specific output files and their contents will depend on the analysis performed.  The final model's performance metrics (e.g., AUC, precision, recall) will also be printed to the console.
